# Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) for Healthcare

This repository contains an implementation of the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm, showcasing its potential applications in healthcare. The DDPG is a reinforcement learning algorithm suitable for continuous action spaces, and in this example, it's used to optimize decision-making tasks in healthcare.

## Requirements

Ensure that you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- `tensorflow`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- Any additional libraries

You can install the dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <https://github.com/eg424/DDPG.git>
cd <ddpg_pendulum.py>
```

2. Install the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the code:

```bash
python <your_script_name>.py
```

The code will perform a task using the DDPG algorithm and demonstrate how AI can be applied to healthcare decision-making problems.

## How It Works

### Code Overview

- **Main Algorithm**: This script implements the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm.
- **Healthcare Environment**: The environment simulates healthcare-related tasks for training the agent.
- **Policy Network**: The neural network model used for decision-making.
- **Training Loop**: The agent interacts with the environment, learns from the outcomes, and optimizes the policy over time.

## Notes

- This implementation uses [insert framework here: TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.], which is necessary for running the code.
- Make sure you adjust the parameters as per the problem you're solving in healthcare.
